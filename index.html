        <b><I>Lorem Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <mark>1500s,</mark> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</I><br></p>
        
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing<br> Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><del>Aldus PageMaker</del></b> including versions of Lorem Ipsum
